Neural Networks
  . Neurons
  . Dendrites : incoming
  . Axons : outgoing one to many
  . Synapses : connect dendrite with axons

  . Neural networks can process vast amounts of data simultaneously, unlike the CPU which executes instructions serially.
  . Neural networks can store and process the data at same time.


***https://course.elementsofai.com Chapter 5.2 completed
Neural Networks
  . Have weights assigned to parameters or labels for calculation
  . Sum of the weights multiplied by number of inputs is called the linear combination of the inputs.
  . linear combination = intercept + (weight1 x input1) + (weight2 x input2) + (weight3 x input3) + (weight4 x input4)..

Neuron Activations and Outputs
  . The linear combination is passed through the activation function.
  . Types of activation functions : Identity function, Step function, Sigmoid function.

Artificial Neural Networks ANN
  . Perceptron
  . Perceptron algorithm, Backpropogation algorithm.
  . Neural network architecture is made up of layers, ex: Input Layer, Hidden Layer, Output Layer.
  . Input Layer -> Directly exposed to data or the input data.
  . Hidden Layer -> Whose neurons take input from neurons from output of neurons of the previous layer.
  . Output Layer -> Layer of neurons which output the result.

Advanced Neural Networks
  . Convolutional Neural Networks
  . CNNs can be added as a layer to existing neural network for increasing efficiency while processing image based inputs.
  . Generative Adversarial network - Combination of two networks - Generative network + Adversarial Network.
  . Attention mechanism -  Generative Pretrained Transformer(GPT).

Azure app service

*Autoscale
 . Scale-up, Scale-down - increase or decrease cpu,ram,etc.
 . Scale in - Scale out - increase or decrease number of instances.

*Deployment slots
 . Deployment slots are live apps with their own host names.

*App service plan tiers - Standard appservice plan, etc
 . An App Service plan defines a set of compute resources for a web app to run.
