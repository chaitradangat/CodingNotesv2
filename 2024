. images are build-time constructs as opposed to containers which are run-time constructs
. image cannot be deleted until all containers running the image are removed
. docker images are made of loosely connected layers

*Containers do not contain their own kernel but use kernel shared by the Host OS

*Image registries

*Jargon 
. muti stage builds
. Docker Compose, Docker Stacks

*Dockerizing Applications
. The directory containing the application is called the build context.
. Its common practice to keep the docker file in the root directory of build context.
. The name of `Dockerfile` is case-sensitive.
. Dockerfile contains the instructions for the docker host engine to build image from the image file Dockerfile.
. All docker files start with FROM keyword which forms the base layer for of the docker image


. docker image build -t web:latest . - builds docker image based on Dockerfile located at build context `.`
. docker login
. docker image tag web:latest nigelpoulton/web:latest  -> retag docker image with repo name before pushing
. docker image push nigelpoulton/web:latest

**Docker Deep Dive 158 of 419 completed

. # is used for adding comments in Dockerfile, all non-commented lines are INSTRUCTIONS in docker
. docker image history <imagename>

*Multistage builds
. COPY --from=storefront /usr/src/atsea/app/react-app/build/ .
. COPY --from=appserver /usr/src/atsea/target/AtSea-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar .
. COPY --from command is used to only copy the application code from build images

*Docker best practices
. leverage the build cache
. cache-hit : when the instructions are same older image with same instruction is re-used as an layer
. cache-miss : new image is built
. ignore the cache by passing --no-cache=true flag during build
. --squash image which has multiple layers , however this disables sharing of the image as layers in other builds
. apt-get install no-install-recommends - installs only the required packages

*Docker commands
. -t flag tags the image, and the -f flag lets you specify the name and location of the Dockerfile.

. docker container logs <containername> -> standalone container logs
. docker service logs  <servicename> -> swarm container logs

*Service Discovery
. service discovery allows all swarm services and containers to find find each other by name given they are on the same network
. under the hood dns resolver in each container and the embedded dns server helps with service discovery
. docker container run -it --name c1 --dns=8.8.8.8 --dns-search=dockercerts.com alpine sh -> custom dns server

*The Kubernetes Book pg 18 of 308
. container runtime interface -> to make different container provider technologies pluggable
. containerd -> default kubernetes conatiner runtime
. Kubernetes is both of the following : cluster, orchestrator

*Kubernetes Cluster
. contains one or more nodes that provide cpu, memory, other resources.
. kubernetes cluster nodes are of two types :
. control plane nodes -> must always be linux
. worker nodes -> can be windows / linux

*The Kubernetes Book pg 22 of 308

. control plane nodes implement Kubernetes intelligence
. every cluster needs atleast one control plane node
. control plane node -> api server, scheduler, controllers
. worker nodes are for running applications

*Services inside the control plane

* API Server
. All requests to change and query the state of cluster go through API Server.
. All internal Kubernetes services communicate with each other via the API server.
. API Server is the front end of Kubernetes

* Deploying or updating an app using Kubernetes follows this process:
1. Describe the requirements in a YAML configuration file
2. Post the configuration file to the API server
3. The request will be authenticated and authorized
4. The updates will be persisted in the cluster store
5. The updates will be scheduled to the cluster

* Cluster Store
. Cluster store holds desired states of all applications and cluster components
. it is based on the etcd distributed database.
. all control plane nodes have a copy of the etcd database

*Kubernetes Controllers -> controller manager controls all controllers
. Deployment Controller
. Statefulset Controller
. ReplicaSet Controller
. controllers run as background watch loops re-conciling desired and actual states

*Kubernetes scheduler
.

. component -> react dom -> browser
. component -> react native -> mobile device
. component -> react desktop -> desktop/laptop
.
.
.

**React and React Native Pg 38 of 606

*Rendering with JSX
. render() function takes jsx as argument
. 

**React and React Native Pg 43 of 606
. React needs root element in the jsx for rendering
. {this.props.children} is used to render the child component inside the custom component
. React class attributes and namespaces

**React and React Native Pg 64 of 606
. array.map((i) => { })
. Object.Keys(i).map((object) => {})
. JSX Fragments using empty <> </> or <div> </div> in fragment custom component elements
. JSX : Javascript XML

*Component Data
. properties
. state
. context

 state = {
    first: false,
    second: true,
  };
const { first, second } = this.state;

//changging the state of the component using setTimeout()

state = {
    heading: "React Awesomesauce (Busy)",

  };
const { heading, content } = this.state;

setTimeout(() => {
      this.setState({
        heading: "React Awesomesauce",
        content: "Done!",
      });
    }, 3000);

*Default / static state properties

static defaultProps = {
    disabled: false,
    text: "My Button",
  };

 const { disabled, text } = this.props;

. properties are immutable unlike state which keeps changing all the time


**React and React Native Pg 84 of 606
. component properties are declared inside the render function
. component properties can be assigned via attributes when using the component in jsx

* Stateless components
. Pure functional components

* Container components
. Stateful components are called container components
. Container components de-couple the data fetching from the component rendering using child components

function fetchData() {
  return new Promise((resolve) => {
    setTimeout(() => {
      resolve(["First", "Second", "Third"]);
    }, 2000);
  });

.  React.useEffect(() => {
    fetchUser().then((user) => {
     setId(user.id);
      setName(user.name);
      });
    });

. useEffect() hook is called after the component finishes rendering

. const [resolved, setResolved] = useState(false);
  useEffect(() => {
  // ...the effect code...
  return () => {
    // ...the cleanup code that depends on "resolved"
  }
  }, [resolved]);

**Handling state dependencies
. 

**React and React Native Pg 151 of 606

** Event handling in React

. Arrow functions do not need function keyword and return keyword
  const lordify = value1 => `${value1} of sometext`;
. const lordify = (firstName, land) => `${firstName} of ${land}`;
.  use round brackets after => when returning objects
   const person = (firstName, lastName) => ({
   first: firstName,
   last: lastName
   }); 

. babel => javascript compiler to convert latest javascript features to javascript compatible with all browsers 

. Destructuring objects
. const obj1 = 
  {
   key1 : value1,
   key2 : value2,
   key3 : value3
  }
  const {key1,key2} = obj1;
  let  {key1, key2} = obj1;

*Destructuring Arrays
.  const [firstAnimal] = ["Horse", "Mouse", "Cat"];
   console.log(firstAnimal); // Horse

.  Spread operator with objects
   const morning = {
   breakfast: "oatmeal",
   lunch: "peanut butter and jelly"
   };
 
   const dinner = "mac and cheese";

   const backpackingMeals = {
   ...morning,

* Javascript Modules
. usually there is one file per module
. module can export multiple types
. export default is used in place of export when only one type is exported from a module.

**CommonJS way of writing modules
. const print(message) => log(message, new Date())
  const log(message, timestamp) =>
  console.log(`${timestamp.toString()}: ${message}`}
  module.exports = {print, log}

*Functional programming with Javascript
. higher-order function
. Array.map Array.reduce
. Array.filter() function is immutable and returns new array.
. Array.map() returns an array after performing operation on each element of the source array.
. Object.keys <- returns all keys of an js object
. Array.reduce(), Array.reduceRight()
. 
. Currying functional technique
