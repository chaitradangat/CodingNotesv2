Neural Networks
  . Neurons
  . Dendrites : incoming
  . Axons : outgoing one to many
  . Synapses : connect dendrite with axons

  . Neural networks can process vast amounts of data simultaneously, unlike the CPU which executes instructions serially.
  . Neural networks can store and process the data at same time.


***https://course.elementsofai.com Chapter 5.2

Neural Networks
  . Have weights assigned to parameters or labels for calculation
  . Sum of the weights multiplied by number of inputs is called the linear combination of the inputs.
  . linear combination = intercept + (weight1 x input1) + (weight2 x input2) + (weight3 x input3) + (weight4 x input4)..
